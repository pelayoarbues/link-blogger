## AI

- [Cisco Unveils AI Defense to Secure the AI Transformation of Enterprises](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2025/m01/cisco-unveils-ai-defense-to-secure-the-ai-transformation-of-enterprises.html?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai-pioneer-launches-new-agi-lab&_bhlid=3a266764898ad8b1a9a8ffb3b357f3409cd647ca): Cisco has unveiled AI Defense, a comprehensive solution designed to protect enterprises navigating the AI landscape. This innovative tool addresses emerging security threats that existing solutions cannot manage, ensuring the secure development and deployment of AI applications. By leveraging Cisco's expertise in network visibility, AI Defense provides model validation, runtime security, access control, and data protection, helping enterprises mitigate risks and maintain compliance as they incorporate AI into their operations.
- [Breaking News: AGI Is Not Imminent!](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-news-agi-is-not-imminent): Gary Marcus argues in his article "Breaking News: AGI Is Not Imminent" that despite recent claims suggesting the near arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), these assertions are premature. Influential figures have been suggesting AGI's development is advancing rapidly, with one individual alleging an emergency meeting due to the accelerated timeline. Sam Altman recently implied confidence in building AGI but later backtracked. Marcus likens this to overhyped tech promises, referencing Elizabeth Holmes as a cautionary example.
- [DeepSeek is Coming for OpenAI’s Neck](https://transitions.substack.com/p/deepseek-is-coming-for-openais-neck?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=40586&post_id=155258400&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=44mvk&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email): In the competitive AI landscape, several companies have emerged as potential rivals to OpenAI. Initially, Anthropic gained attention as an AI safety-focused alternative, founded by former OpenAI members. Mistral also briefly contended with its open-source approach but eventually shifted towards proprietary models. Currently, DeepSeek is making significant strides by introducing DeepSeek-V3, an open-source model outperforming GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, developed cost-efficiently at under $6 million. DeepSeek emphasizes an open AI approach, exemplified by its MIT-licensed releases like DeepSeek R1.
- [The Rise of Synthetic Respondents in Market Research:](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/education/2024/the-rise-of-synthetic-respondents/): The text discusses the emergence of synthetic respondents in market research, highlighting their use as artificial personas generated by machine learning to quickly evaluate and optimize new product concepts. While these synthetic models offer potential advantages such as speed and cost-effectiveness, they also pose challenges, like ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their output. The article emphasizes the importance of integrating recent and relevant data, continuous calibration, and rigorous validation to maintain data quality and provide actionable insights. It warns against relying solely on synthetic feedback without validating it against real consumer data, underscoring that synthetic models should complement, not replace, human insights. The piece also underscores the ongoing AI revolution's impact on consumer insights, urging careful navigation of its opportunities and risks.
## Economics

- [Trumpcoin and TikTok](https://kyla.substack.com/p/trumpcoin-and-tiktok?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=91531&post_id=155187443&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=44mvk&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email): The article "Trumpcoin and TikTok" by Kyla Scanlon discusses the phenomenon of attention-driven wealth creation exemplified by Trumpcoin, a memecoin launched by Trump and his team before his second presidential inauguration. Within days, it generated tens of billions in paper wealth through narrative speculation, highlighting the power of attention in modern markets. This shift, described as the "Attention Singularity," bypasses traditional economic progressions, leveraging immediate political influence and digital platforms. Trump's potential acquisition of TikTok further showcases the merging of political power and narrative control, amplifying the cycle of attention creating wealth, wealth enabling power, and power attracting more attention. This accelerating dynamic poses significant implications for investors and consumers in an era where speculative assets and digital presence dominate real production.
## Data Science

- [The Rise of the Data Platform Engineer](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/the-rise-of-the-data-platform-engineer): The article by Pedram Navid explores the evolving roles within data science and engineering, highlighting the transition from Data Scientists to Data Engineers and now to Data Platform Engineers. Initially, Data Scientists were the focal point, but as the field matured, the need for robust data infrastructure became evident, elevating Data Engineers who specialized in ETL pipelines and data transformation. As the industry progressed, the burden of building custom pipelines shifted, prompting the rise of the Data Platform Engineer. This role focuses on creating platforms and frameworks to enable seamless data operations without needing intricate pipelines, reflecting an evolution towards more strategic, scalable approaches. The maturation of tools and frameworks signifies a move towards higher productivity, positioning Data Platform Engineers as crucial enablers for the future of data management.
## Real estate

- [Cuatro Observaciones (Y Tres Preguntas) Sobre El Nuevo Índice De Referencia Para La Actualización Del Alquiler De Vivienda](https://nadaesgratis.es/admin/cuatro-observaciones-y-tres-preguntas-sobre-el-nuevo-indice-de-referencia-para-la-actualizacion-del-alquiler-de-vivienda): The article discusses the new "Índice de Referencia para la Actualización del Alquiler de Vivienda" (IRAV) introduced by Spain's National Statistics Institute (INE) to regulate rental price updates, as per the May 2023 Housing Law. The IRAV aims to curb excessive rent increases, acting as a cap and an alternative to previous government-imposed limits. The regulation, effective from January 2025, links rent increases to the lowest of four inflation-related measures, effectively reducing the real rent price over time, especially in designated "tensioned zones." This could lead to a decrease in housing supply as landlords might withdraw properties from the rental market, exacerbating housing scarcity, contrary to its intent to make housing more affordable.
